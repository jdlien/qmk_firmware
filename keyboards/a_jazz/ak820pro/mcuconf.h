// docs/HARDWARE_PWM.md for the column->(timer,channel) map and PFPA constants.
// (No SN32_PWM_NO_RESET: hardware PWM wants the period match to auto-reset the
// counter; only the old software-PWM path re-armed the counter manually.)
// The ChibiOS OS-tick free-running counter defaults to CT16B0 -- but hardware PWM
// needs CT16B0 (column C14 can ONLY route to CT16B0.3). Move the tick counter to
// the otherwise-unused CT16B5 so CT16B0 is free for PWM. (The tick interrupt runs
// on the ARM Cortex SysTick regardless; only the free-running counter uses a CT16.)

 * was being blocked by it: measured 15385 Hz against 20000 configured, i.e. 23%
 * of ticks lost. Lost ticks make the pulse train irregular, which reads as
 * backlight flicker regardless of the nominal switching rate.
 *
 * Safe to put above it: this handler is a counter, a compare and a few GPIO
 * writes, on the order of a microsecond, so it cannot meaningfully delay
 * anything else -- including the CH582F UART, whose byte time is ~87us. */
/* Interrupt priority ordering (lower number = higher priority). Getting this
 * wrong is what caused both the Bluetooth throughput collapse and the backlight
 * flicker, so the reasoning is spelled out:
 *
 *   1  UART2 (CH582F)  -- byte-loss critical. A missed ACK stalls a TX frame for
 *                         CH582_TX_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS; at 3.7 retries per frame that
 *                         is ~7 characters/second and you can out-type the link.
 *   2  GPT CT16B3      -- the backlight/indicator PWM tick. Tiny (a counter, a
 *                         compare, a few GPIO writes) but must be REGULAR:
 *                         dropped ticks make the pulse train uneven, which reads
 *                         as flicker. At the stock priority 3 it sat below the
 *                         row scan and lost 23% of its ticks (measured 15385 Hz
 *                         against 20000 configured).
 *   3  RGB row scan    -- long (reloads 15 PWM channels) but latency-tolerant;
 *                         a few microseconds of delay is invisible on an LED.
 *
 * The defaults had this inverted: UART 3, PWM 2, GPT 3. */
