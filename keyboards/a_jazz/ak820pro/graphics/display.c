 *
 * PANEL_BKL (A16) is a plain GPIO. Hardware PWM on it is IMPOSSIBLE, not merely
 * unused: the SN32F299 datasheet gives P0.16 the single alternate function
 * CT16B5_CAP0, a capture INPUT. So brightness is software PWM.
 *
 * The tick is CT16B3 (GPTD4) at a MEASURED 20000 Hz -- a dedicated timer, set up
 * in pwm_tick_init() in ak820pro.c. It used to run from a weak hook in the RGB
 * RGB row-scan ISR), which welded the switching rate to RGB_MATRIX_SPD_STEP:
 * retuning the LED field rate for the rainbow artifact silently retuned the
 * backlight into or out of flicker. THAT COUPLING IS GONE -- SPD_STEP no longer
 * affects this at all.
 *
 * Period is BKL_PWM_TICKS: 20000/48 = 417 Hz switching, floor 1/48 = 2.1%.
 * A dimmer floor needs a LONGER period, which lowers the switching rate; the
 * tick rate is now independent, so that trade is purely period-vs-floor.
 *
 * The levels are spaced perceptually, not linearly. Brightness perception is
 * roughly a power law, so an even duty spread wastes most of its steps at the
 * top where they are indistinguishable and gives nothing usable at the bottom,
 * which is the end that matters in a dark room. */

 *
 *   icons -> text   2

 *   clock -> lock   8
 *   lock  -> batt   8
 *
 * Those last two read as one visual gap each side of the lock row, and they
 * were 6 and 8 before -- visibly lopsided. Balancing them took THREE coupled
 * moves, not one: the lock row down 1, the battery down 1 (the 20px cell needs

 * 34 rows were blank by construction (5 above the digits, 7 below). Cropping
 * to the measured ink freed those 12 rows AND cut 34 KB off the asset blob.
 * The glyphs themselves are untouched, pixel for pixel; only the cell moved.
 *
 * That is what paid for the 2px gaps and for keeping the battery percentage at
 * 20px. Before the crop the panel was full to the row and every one of these
 * was a trade against another.
 *
 * ⚠️ DESCENDERS ARE CLIPPED IN THAT ATLAS. g/p/q/y and friends lost their
 * tails, because nothing but the clock draws with FONT_CLOCK. If you ever draw
 * general text at this size, regenerate the atlas at its full 15x34 cell and

 * same loop that scans the matrix. Measured at 53 ms, which at typing speed
 * (a character roughly every 125 ms) is ample to swallow a keystroke. Isolated
 * by experiment: with the host text producer stopped, four reboots produced
 * zero stalls over 15 ms; with it running, 53 ms on both boots.
 *
 * Most of that is per-glyph OVERHEAD, not data: a 6x14 glyph is 168 bytes, but
 * each one pays a window command, a flash read command, and a DMA arm.
 *
 * The band now paints ONE LINE per housekeeping pass, composed in RAM and
 * blitted once (lcd_draw_flash_text_staged), holding text_dirty until it
 * finishes. A line costs a few ms instead of ~26, and a two-line update
 * completes in two ticks -- fast enough to read as instant.

 * lcd_draw_flash_text_staged() removes the need to spread the work at all: it
 * pays the per-glyph setup once and issues a single blit for the line, so a
 * line costs a few ms rather than ~26. Budgeting by LINE then keeps the worst
 * pass small while a two-line update still completes in two ticks (~200 ms) and
