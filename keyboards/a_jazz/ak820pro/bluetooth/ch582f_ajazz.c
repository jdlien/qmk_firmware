 * (`5B 36`) or otherwise settles. Pressing a slot key issues a connect, so a

 * is silently dropped.
 *
 * Symptom this caused: hold 1 s -> nothing, hold 2 s -> nothing, hold 3 s ->

 *   [tx] A6 32 select    -> [rx] 5B 23   idle. No 33 (attempting), no 32.
 *   [tx] A6 33 select    -> [rx] 5B 36
 *   [tx] A6 32 select    -> [rx] 5B 32   works after the back-and-forth
 *
 * Note it is NOT a lost frame: the module answers, with `5B 23`. It stops
 * advertising and simply never starts connecting. Symptom: after entering
 * pairing and going back to a paired device, it will not reconnect until you
 * switch slots back and forth.
 *
 * The select is otherwise NEVER re-issued once module_alive is set (see the
 * cold-boot retry below), so a declined select is unrecoverable by design.
 *
 * Retry ONLY while the module has not started an attempt. A working select is
 * answered with 33/34/32 inside a second (measured), so absence of any of those
 * is a reliable "it declined". This deliberately does NOT re-issue once 33/34
 * has arrived -- that is exactly the slow macOS directed-advertising case the
 * cold-boot guard protects, where re-selecting restarts advertising and starves
 * a reconnect that was progressing fine.
 *
 * SECOND MEASUREMENT (the first fix was too impatient and did NOT work):
 *
 *   5B 31            advertising starts
 *   A6 32   +2s      declined
 *   reselect +3s     declined
 *   reselect +4s     declined      <- gave up here
 *   5B 23    +6s     module goes IDLE, one second too late
 *
 * The module ignores a select for as long as it is advertising, and only becomes
 * receptive once it emits `5B 23` (idle/finalize). Three tries over ~3.6 s all
 * landed inside the advertising window. So the retry is now driven by that
 * EVENT, not only by the clock: a `5B 23` while a select is pending re-issues it
 * immediately, which is the exact moment the module is free. The timed retry
 * remains as a backstop and the try budget is wider (8). */
