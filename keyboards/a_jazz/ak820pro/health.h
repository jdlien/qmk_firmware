/* Unified health counters.
 *
 * The counters accumulate in RAM unconditionally (they cost a compare and an
 * increment); only the REPORTING differs by build flavor. Raw HID is the
 * primary channel -- it exists in every build, and console-only
 * observability disappears during exactly the stalls being investigated.
 * The console [health] line is the instrumented-flavor extra.
 *
 * Lessons this design carries (from the loop-gap investigation):
 * an instrument must not touch the subsystem under test -- reporting goes to
 * an inert sink, never the panel; and thresholds/quantisation sit well above
 * the noise floor so the output cannot become continuous traffic. */

 * CONSOLIDATION (~every 127 entries: two 1 KB sector erases, synchronous and
 * unmasked, believed 50-300 ms). Counting writes here plus flash_gap_max_ms
