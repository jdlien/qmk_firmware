/* ---- Per-row input sampling (LOOP-BUDGET phase 1b) --------------------------
 *
 * Until 2026-09-03 the SN32 driver published after scanning ONE row, so
 * scan_rate (which counts matrix_scan() calls) was NOT a full-matrix refresh
 * rate, and an aliasing beat between the consume rate and the PWM row cycle
 * left a key unsampled for up to 169 ms. These counters found that; the driver
 * now scans every row every cycle (firmware e6cce28858) and they stay to keep
 * it measurable. Expected today: every row sampled ~215 times a second, i.e.
 * ~4 rows per main-loop consume, worst gap ~5 ms outside flash programming.
 *
 * row_samples  -- fairness: are all rows sampled equally often? u16: wraps
 *                 every ~5 min at 215/s; row_samples_total (page 4) is u32.
 * row_gap_max  -- worst observed interval between samples of the SAME row,
 *                 kept in system ticks and converted to ms at read time
 * raw_edges    -- raw matrix transitions seen at consume time, i.e. BEFORE
 *                 debounce. Compare against key_presses (which is AFTER
 *                 debounce, in process_record_kb): a press and its release are
 *                 two raw edges, so raw_edges ~= 2 x key_presses when nothing

/* ---- Row-ISR cost ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * rgb_callback() re-arms the PWM counter at its END, so its period is (ISR
 * duration + ~53 us), and the ISR's own cost -- not the timer -- sets the row
 * rate. The timer arithmetic predicts 18,750 ISR/s; the per-row counters above
 * measured ~3,870. That is the difference between "1 ms" and "4.6 ms" per key,
 * and it is also the ceiling on the main loop, so it is measured here rather
 * than argued: entries, summed and min/max duration, in system ticks
