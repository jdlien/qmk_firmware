/* --- Indicator LEDs -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Caps Lock (D15), Win Lock (C15) and Charging (B18) are plain GPIOs, and at
 * full drive they are painfully bright on a desk in a dark room -- the charging
 * one especially, since it is not under user control at all.
 *
 * So they are software-PWM'd rather than switched, sharing the 20 kHz CT16B3
 * tick the LCD backlight uses (pwm_tick_cb below). Same duty curve and the same
 * reasoning: perceptually spaced, because a linear ramp wastes its steps at the
 * top and gives nothing usable at the bottom. Level 0 is fully off, if you would
 * rather lose an indicator than see it.
 *
 * These functions only record desired state now; the ISR drives the pins. */
/* 96 rather than the backlight's 64, tuned on hardware.
 *
 * Minimum brightness is always 1 tick, so a dimmer floor needs a longer period
 * -- which lowers the switching frequency, since one pulse per period IS the
 * fundamental. At a given low brightness and tick rate the flicker frequency is
 * therefore fixed; the only real lever is the tick rate, and raising that costs
 * matrix scan rate.
 *
 * Measured on this unit:
 * Measured at the OLD 18750/s ISR rate:
 *   64 ticks  -> 293 Hz, 1/64 (1.6%)   no flicker, slightly too bright
 *   128 ticks -> 146 Hz, 1/128 (0.78%) good brightness, Caps visibly flickered
 *   96 ticks  -> 195 Hz, 1/96 (1.0%)   the compromise
 *
 * This no longer rides the RGB row ISR. It ticks from CT16B3 (GPTD4) at a
 * measured 20000 Hz, so RGB_MATRIX_SPD_STEP does not affect it and the old
 * three-way coupling between LED field rate, backlight and indicators is gone.
 *
 * If flicker reappears, shorten this (brighter, faster) rather than reaching for
 * the ISR rate. */
