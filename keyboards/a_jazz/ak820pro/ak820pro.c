/*
 * Defer eeconfig flushes away from LCD DMA activity.
 *
 * Confirmed failure: adjusting RGB writes eeconfig on every step, and an SN32 EFL
 * program/erase overlapping an in-flight flash->LCD DMA blit wedges the board --
 * LED row mux frozen mid-cycle, raw HID dead, USB still enumerated, recoverable
 * only by a power cycle. Console capture caught it ending on
 * "rgb matrix set hsv [EEPROM]" with the next line never arriving.
 *
 * efl_ramtext.diff (flash routines in SRAM) narrows this but does not close it,
 * and CORTEX_ENABLE_WFI_IDLE FALSE does not fix it either -- that only removed
 * the lost-wakeup half of the failure described in config.h; the missed SPI0 DMA
 * completion is the half that actually bites.
 *
 * So simply do not start a flash write while a blit is in flight. Paired with
 * RGB_MATRIX_EEPROM_WRITE_DELAY this also cuts the write rate from ~8/s while a
 * key is held to at most one per interval, which matters for flash wear too.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on anim_active(): the animation player runs continuous
 * DMA, and blocking on it would mean RGB settings never persist while an
 * animation is on. Blits are short, so per-blit gating still finds gaps.
 */

 *
 * WHY THIS IS BROADER THAN rgb_matrix_eeprom_flush_allowed() BELOW: that hook
 * only gates RGB's own eeconfig flush, which was the trigger we happened to
 * notice first. VIA's dynamic-keymap writes take a completely different path and
 * were never covered -- assigning keys in VIA reproduced the hang (one LED row
 * stuck lit, board dead until a power cycle) on 2026-08-29. The bug was never
 * about RGB; it is about ANY internal-flash write overlapping the LCD DMA.
 *
 * Waiting is sufficient rather than merely narrowing the window: flash writes are
 * synchronous on the main loop, and blits are started from the main loop too, so
 * once the in-flight blit has drained no new one can begin before the write
 * completes.
 *
 * Bounded like every other blit wait here -- an unbounded spin would trade an
 * intermittent hang for a guaranteed one if a completion interrupt is ever
 * genuinely lost. */

     * cannot run to arm the next row and the matrix goes DARK. Observed on

     * flash wear, and cuts exposure to the still-unexplained RGB-adjust hang,
     * whose trigger is an internal-flash write.
