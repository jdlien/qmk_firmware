// --- Field rate vs PWM resolution ------------------------------------------
// The 18 hardware rows (6 key rows x R,B,G) are lit one at a time, one row per
// PWM period, so a key's three colour channels fire in separate time slots. The
// full R->B->G cycle rate is:
//
//     freq / periodticks / SN32F2XX_RGB_MATRIX_ROWS_HW
//
// where drivers/led/sn32f2xx.c sets periodticks = RGB_MATRIX_MAXIMUM_BRIGHTNESS
// and, oddly, derives the PWM clock from the UI step sizes:
//     freq = HUE_STEP * SAT_STEP * VAL_STEP * SPD_STEP * LED_PROCESS_LIMIT
//
// Stock (8*16*16*16*17 = 557056, /255, /18) = 121 Hz. That clears flicker fusion
// when the eyes are still, but the ~0.46 ms channel spacing smears into visible
// colour fringes during a saccade -- the DLP "rainbow" artifact.
//
// There are two ways to raise the field rate, and they are NOT equivalent:
//
//   - Lower periodticks. Costs PWM resolution, because periodticks is also the
//     val ceiling and the driver feeds the raw colour byte straight in as duty
//     (pwmEnableChannel(..., led_state[i].b)). An earlier revision did this
//     (128 -> 242 Hz) and it was the wrong trade: this board is run dim in a
//     dark room, so coarsening the low end is exactly the wrong thing to spend.
//     (Duty also sets how wide each colour's image is while the R->B->G spacing
//     stays fixed, so a short pulse gives crisper, better-separated bars -- but
//     that is a second-order effect. The reason the artifact stands out in a
//     dark room is mostly dark adaptation and contrast, not the duty cycle.)
//   - Raise freq. Costs only UI step granularity, and PWM_CLK is SN32_HCLK
//     (48 MHz) against a current freq of ~0.56 MHz, so there is ample headroom.
//
// Raising freq is strictly better here, and SPD_STEP is the right factor to
// spend: it sets only the animation-speed step, meaningless on solid_color.
// SPD_STEP 16 -> 64 quadruples freq, which lets periodticks go back to the full
// 255 (all 256 brightness levels restored, and VAL_STEP 8 now yields 31 dimming
// steps instead of 16 -- finer low-end control, which is the point).
//
//   freq = 16*16*8*64*17 = 2228224
//   psc  = 48e6/2228224 - 1 = 20  (integer division; hal_pwm_lld.c:293)
//   effective freq = 48e6/21 = 2285714 Hz
//   field rate = 2285714 / 256 / 18 = 496 Hz   (4.1x the 121 Hz stock)
//
// SPD_STEP 128 is the current setting: freq 4456448, psc 9, effective 4.8 MHz,
// field rate 4.8e6/255/18 = 1046 Hz, row ISR ~18800/s. This is the highest
// field rate reachable without spending periodticks (i.e. without giving up
// dimming resolution), and the rainbow artifact is at its least visible here.
//
// IT WAS PREVIOUSLY BACKED OUT because it broke Bluetooth -- you could out-type
// the link. That diagnosis was half right and the stated mechanism was WRONG:
//
//   - WRONG: "the RX FIFO is DISABLED, so a byte must be serviced within ~87us."
//     The FIFO is enabled. UART_RxFIFOThreshold_1 is 0x00 and the LLD
//     unconditionally ORs UART_FIFO_Enable, so the threshold is a trigger level,
//     not a disable. The real budget is the FIFO depth, not one byte time.
//
//   - RIGHT: the row ISR really was stealing UART servicing. But that was an
//     interrupt PRIORITY inversion, not a raw rate problem: SN32_SERIAL_UART2
//     defaulted to priority 3 while the PWM row ISR sat at 2, so the row scan
//     could preempt byte servicing no matter how fast or slow it ran.
//
// mcuconf.h now sets UART2 to priority 1, GPT CT16B3 to 2, and the PWM row ISR
// to 3. The row ISR can no longer preempt the UART at any rate, which is what
// makes 128 safe again. If Bluetooth throughput ever regresses, verify that
// ordering FIRST -- do not reflexively drop SPD_STEP.
//
// The old coupling to BKL_PWM_TICKS / IND_PWM_TICKS IS GONE. The backlight and
// indicator software PWM used to tick from the row ISR, so their switching
// rates moved with this constant. They now run from a dedicated 20 kHz GPT
// (CT16B3/GPTD4, see pwm_tick_init in ak820pro.c), measured at 20000 Hz. This
// constant no longer affects them at all.
//
// Reference points: matrix scan 1396 Hz at 2189/s, ~1050 Hz at 8963/s, ~585 Hz
// at 18800/s. Measure with `qmk console` (DEBUG_MATRIX_SCAN_RATE is on).
//
// NOTE: changing periodticks reinterprets every STORED val -- EEPROM survives a
// flash, so the board comes back at a different brightness and needs re-dimming
// by hand. Keep RGB_MATRIX_DEFAULT_VAL in keyboard.json scaled to the ceiling
// (64/255 ~= the same 25% output as the old 32/128).

/* ⚠️ THE STEP SIZES NO LONGER AFFECT THE FIELD RATE. Read this before tuning.
 *
 * The SonixQMK driver derived the LED PWM clock from the PRODUCT of the four UI
 * step sizes and LED_PROCESS_LIMIT, so making any one of them finer silently
 * halved the field rate and brought the DLP-rainbow artifact back. That forced
 * every granularity choice to be paid for by coarsening another axis.
 *
 * SN32F2XX_RGB_PWM_FREQ (added to drivers/led/sn32f2xx.c) pins the clock
 * instead, so the steps below are now purely a UI decision. 4,800,000 gives
 * psc = 48e6/4.8e6 - 1 = 9, an effective 4.8 MHz, and 4.8e6/256/18 = 1042 Hz --

//
// During the hang: USB still enumerated (0x8009, all 6 HID interfaces), but a
// raw-HID round-trip returned "no reply" and the LED row mux was frozen with one
// hardware row still energised. So the USB peripheral was alive while nothing at
